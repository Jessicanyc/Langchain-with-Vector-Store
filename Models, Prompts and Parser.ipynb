    "Why would I even use a prompt template? \n",
    "- prompt can be long and details\n",
    "    - an example of a relatively long prompt to grade a student's submission for an online learning application. \n",
    "    - a prompt like this can be quite long, in which you can ask the LLM to first solve the problem, and then have the output in a certain format, and the output in a certain format. \n",
    "     - And wrapping this in a LangChain prompt makes it easier to reuse a prompt like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Reusability\n",
    "    - Prompt templates allow you to define a template once and reuse it in multiple places. This avoids duplicating the same prompt logic over and over. For example, you could create a “summarize article” template and reuse it anytime you want a summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separation of concerns\n",
    "    - Prompt templates separate the prompt formatting from the model invocation. This makes the code more modular you can change the template or the model independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic prompts\n",
    "    - Templates allow you to dynamically generate prompts by filling in template variables. This is useful when you want to customize the prompt based on user input or other runtime factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Readability\n",
    "    - Templates can improve readability by encapsulating complex prompt logic in a simple interface. Named variables are often clearer than trying to embed logic directly in strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintenance\n",
    "    - Changes to shared prompt logic only need to happen in one place rather than everywhere a prompt is defined. This improves maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary, prompt templates improve reusability, modularity and maintenance of prompt engineering code compared to using raw prompt strings directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chat prompt templates\n",
    "    - For chat models, LangChain provides ChatPromptTemplate which allows creating a template for a list of chat messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use the provided chat message classes like AIMessage, HumanMessage, etc or plain tuples to define the chat messages.\n",
